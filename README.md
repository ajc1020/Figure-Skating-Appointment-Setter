# Figure-Skating-Appointment-Setter

The purpose of my project is to create a program that will make figure skating lesson appointments for an Ice Rink. The program will create a profile for the user, who is a potential figure skating student, and then create a text file that will serve as an appointment reminder card. The problem that my program is solving is reducing the amount of time that coaches or rinks may spend doing intake to make appointments. The program will be a solution by automating the appointment setting system and optimizing the process. The algorithm operates by synthesizing user input in a Student object with already existing attributes of Coach objects to create a Lesson object. It has several functions which serve to check the validity of user input. The user creates a student profile, then selects a coach based on the student’s skill level. The user then selects a date and time. This information is then written onto a text file as the reminder. The limitations of this program are its inability to create multiple appointments or multiple student profiles. The program could benefit from being able to store multiple student objects, or to create recurring appointments once the initial one is booked.
